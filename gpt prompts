prompt:
i am working on developing a model to assign a priority category to a range of clinical tasks to help GP's better manage their workloads. Create me a dataset where each row is a task, with the following features:

Task Type: string, possible values are [prescription request, patient communication (via phone, NHS app, AccuRX), sick notes, referral letters, medical reports, review results]
Comorbidities: multiple columns, all boolean: [epilepsy, historical heart attack / stroke, diabetes, mental health].  
BMI: numeric value
Time since task requested: numeric value (hours/days)
Estimated task duration: numeric (minutes / hours)
Critical result flag: if task type is review results, then this can be 0 or 1. indicates if the result fell extremely far out of acceptable range. e.g. very high white blood cell count

Outcome variable is a colour coded priority flag (red, amber, green). Red is highest priority.

Use some of this logic to assign priority values according to the above features:
patient communication and reviewing results should be correlated with higher priority score. 
There is an interaction between comorbidities and task type. e.g. epilepsy sufferer and prescription request = high priority. historical heart attach and prescription request = medium priority. 
Lower priority tasks can move up the order of prioritisation if they have been in the system for longer. takes longer for green tasks to move into orange tasks vs orange into red.

prompt: 
lets add in some more variables: 
within prescription requests, the following fields should influence the prioritisation label:

type of medication - value should be type of medication. each of these has its own level of risk, should they not be administered. e.g., high risk: insulin, anti-epileptics, immunosuppresants. medium risk: blood pressure medication, statins, SSRI
low risk: vitamins, emollients, mild pain relief
days until out of supply: numeric, can be negative if already run out. <=1 days is emergency, 2-3 days if medium priority, anything more if low priority
polypharmacy: yes or no depending on if more than 5 medications. polypharmacy should be prioritised more
request type: string. higher priority if value is out-of-hours gp, phramacist, phone. routine requests via online or nhs app is medium. routine scheduled repeats is low
monitoring required: true or false. if monitoring is required before prescribing. if true, then higher priority

result:
